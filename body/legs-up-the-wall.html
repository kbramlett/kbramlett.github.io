            <p><strong>At the end of a long day of sitting or standing, doing “legs up the wall” pose is an easy thing to do to create the following health boosts:</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>1) Encourage circulation in the lower extremities by letting gravity help in moving out stagnate fluids 
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>2) Relax muscle tension by accepting the support of the floor and wall</p>

            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>3) Gently encourage and develop better flexibility in the backs of legs and low back
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>4) Reduce overall fatigue
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>5) Soothe the nervous system 
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>6) Help reduce swelling in the legs and feet
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p><strong>To take the pose
            </strong></p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Step 1: Find a place on the floor or in bed near a wall. 
            </p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Step 2: From a seated position, scoot one hip very close to the wall
            </p>

            </div>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Step 3: Begin to lean back while lifting your legs up and rotating your butt toward the wall
            </p>

            </div>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Step 4: Lie back. Adjust your position until you feel comfortable with your legs resting against the wall. You could place a pillow under your head, experiment with different arm positions, or wear an eye mask for increased relaxation. The options are up to you!
