        <h3>Build a basic spice collection on a budget</h3>

        <p>If you’re new(-ish) to cooking and want to get your spice rack ready, here’s a list of spices you’ll need for
            a few generic flavor profiles. You can always add more spices later as you gain more experience with
            layering flavors and explore different geographical regions, but this will get you started! In my
            experience, you can find most of these things at a typical grocery store, but if you have an ethnic market
            to check out, those locations tend have the best prices and variety for spices for their own specialized
            cuisine.</p>

        <p>Tip: Experiment with adding amounts of spices to your own taste. I mention below which spices are really
            potent by saying “a little goes a long way”. Otherwise, it’s hard to mess up amounts of the other spices.
            Follow your taste buds!

    <h3>Italian</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic: granulated, powdered, fresh, or garlic-infused oil</li>
            <li>Dried Italian seasoning or plain Oregano</li>
            <li>Olive oil (extra virgin for the best flavor; good for dipping bread, making salad dressings, and cooking
                at
                lower heat)</li>
            <li>Crushed red pepper if you like a little heat</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    </div>
    <img>
    <p>Quick recipe suggestion: Add these spices to a can or jar of tomato sauce or canned tomatoes. Add salt to
        taste. Simmer on the stove until heated through (or longer for more developed flavor) and serve over pasta
        or baked spaghetti squash. This sauce would also be great on homemade pizza!</p>

    <h3>Chinese</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Soy sauce: regular or low-sodium (for gluten-free diets get Tamari or Liquid Aminos)</li>
        <li>Toasted Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Ginger: ground/powdered is the longest-lasting, but fresh minced ginger can’t be beat in terms of flavor
            and
            low price. You do have to get the brown peel off, which can be a bit labor-intensive but so worth it! It
            also comes in a jar already minced if you don’t want to process it.</li>
            <li>Scallion (AKA Green Onion)</li>
        <li>Rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Garlic: granulated, powdered, fresh (ideal), or garlic-infused oil</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper, Sriracha, or chili garlic sauce for heat</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/Images/chinesenoodles.jpg" alt="A bowl of noodles with Chinese stir-fried veggies on top">

    </div>
    <p>Quick recipe suggestion: Chop some of your favorite veggies (broccoli, bell pepper, carrot, and onion are
        great options) or grab some bags of frozen veggies. Lightly sauté the minced ginger, minced garlic, and chopped scallion in a little sesame
        oil in a skillet or wok for a minute or two. Then add the veggies and sauté until heated through but still a
        bit firm. Then add a splash of soy sauce in place of salt (or one of the substitutes listed above), a little
        rice vinegar, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Let the mixture sauté for another few minutes, stirring
        occasionally. Serve over rice, rice noodles, or soba noodles.</p>

    <h3>Indian</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
        <li>Garam masala</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ground Cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/Images/indiancurriedveggies.jpg" alt="A bowl of noodles with Chinese stir-fried veggies on top">

    </div>
    <p>Quick recipe suggestion: Add a table spoon or two of oil to a sauce pan and heat it up. Sauté the garlic and
        ginger. Add the rest of the spices to the oil until they’re fragrant (but not beginning to darken in color
        or burn). Add a can of drained and rinsed kidney beans, lentils, or chickpeas. Add salt to taste. For a
        richer stew-like texture, add a little water or veggie broth until you achieve the texture you want. For
        extra creaminess and richness, add a can of coconut milk. Serve over rice and/or eat with naan bread.</p>

    <h3>Tex-Mex</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground Cumin</li>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Chipotle powder if you want a smoky flavor (a little goes a long way)</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/Images/tostadas.jpg" alt="A bowl of noodles with Chinese stir-fried veggies on top">

    </div>

    <p>Quick recipe suggestion: Heat a tablespoon or two of oil in a skillet. Add the spices and stir them into the
        oil until fragrant (only a minute or maybe less!). Add crumbled tempeh, tofu, or black beans. Add salt to
        taste. Heat through and get the spices thoroughly mixed into the protein. Serve on taco shells with lettuce
        and tomato or put it in tortillas for burritos.</p>

    <h3>Thai</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Thai curry paste: red, green, yellow, etc. Pick one or two and try them out. (authentic brands from
            Asian
            markets are best and usually pretty spicy!)</li>
        <li>Coconut milk (the thick kind in a can)</li>
        <li>Liquid Aminos as a fish sauce substitute</li>
        <li>Fresh Thai Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/Images/thaicurry.jpg" alt="A bowl of noodles with Chinese stir-fried veggies on top">

    </div>
    <p>Quick recipe suggestion: Bring a can of coconut milk to a simmer in a pot. Add a table spoon or two of the
        curry paste and let it dissolve into the coconut milk. Add chopped bell pepper, eggplant, and cubed tofu.
        Add liquid aminos or soy sauce to taste in place of salt. Let it simmer for 10 minutes or so, until the
        veggies are cooked to your preferred level. Add some basil leaves, amount up to you. Serve over rice.</p>
