        <p><strong>This soba noodle soup is comforting, nutritious, quick, and easy!</strong></p>
        <p>Even better, the recipe is flexible, so you can use a lot of what you have on hand rather than tracking down lots of obscure ingredients. You could also make it without noodles if you're following a grain-free diet.</p> 
        <p><strong>This recipe serves 2, and it's easy to scale up, if you like.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Bok choy or some other crunchy green, leafy veggie </strong>(if you have it)</p>
        <p><strong>2 servings of soba noodles</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Miso paste - a tablespoon or two</strong></p>
        <p><strong>3 cups of veggie stock or water</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Options for garnish:</strong></p>

        </ul>

        <p><strong>PREPARATION</strong></p>
        <p>Step 1: Begin by boiling water to prepare the soba noodles according to the instructions on the package.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Chop the aromatics and other veggies you've chosen.</p>
        <p>Step 3: Heat a wok or large stock pot, and add a couple tablespoons of cooking oil.</p>
        <p>Step 4: Saute the aromatics until they become fragrant and soften.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Step 5: Add the other veggies (fresh and frozen) and let them cook until they soften a bit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Step 6: While the veggies saute, add the noodles to the boiling water. Soba noodles usually cook fast, so don't let them go too long.</p>
        <p>Step 7: Drain and rinse the soba noodles and set them aside.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Step 8: Add the veggie stock or water and miso paste to the veggies. Let this simmer for a few minutes until the miso paste has dissolved and the veggies have cooked to your preferred texture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>Step 9: As the soup simmers, taste along the way and add anything you think is missing. It could be soy sauce or salt for a more savory flavor, chile peppers for more heat, more miso paste or oil for a richer broth, etc.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>Step 10: When you feel the soup has simmered to your liking, divide the soba noodles into bowls and then ladle the soup over the noodles.</p>

        <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
        <p>This recipe goes together very quickly and doesn't require a lot of specific ingredients and measurements. You can customize it based on what you like and what you already have in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>If you don't already keep miso paste on hand, definitely check it out. It works in lots of recipes, has probiotic benefits (when you cook it at lower temps), and keeps in the fridge for a whole year!</p>
        <p>Soba noodles have quite a bit of protein and cook very quickly. They're an excellent option of you're craving some pasta!</p>
