<p>The spiritual aspects of life include our deepest sense of self, our “place” in the universe, and our sense of connection with our friends, families, and communities. 
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Spending time cultivating our sense of self, savoring the sweet moments in life, strengthening our relationships, and taking good care of our communities helps us grow and live a more fulfilling life. 
</p>


<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Many people develop their spirituality in a religious community, but for people who have chosen not to follow a prescribed religious path or theistic tradition, there are many other ways to enrich ourselves in a spiritual sense.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Here are four excellent ways to enrich your spirituality outside the establishments of formal religion:</p>

<div class="article-description">
<p>Developed in the 1980s as a response to the rise in digital overload, the Japanese practice of shirin-yoku (forest bathing) is a type of meditation that focuses specifically on nature and its beauty as we experience it through our senses.</p> 
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Researchers have found that forest bathing improves our health in many ways by decreasing anxiety, improving sleep, lowering blood pressure, decreasing inflammation, and boosting overall mood.

<div class="article-description">
    <p><strong>Here’s how to do it:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Find a piece of nature to immerse yourself in.</strong>
</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be an exotic location. Any natural setting will provide lots to observe: a park, a pretty neighborhood street, or an actual forest, if you can get there, will do! You can walk gently or find a beautiful place to sit on a bench or picnic blanket. 
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>2) Unplug from the digital devices. Remain present in the experience. 
</strong></p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>3) Notice the sensory inputs surrounding you</strong></p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Take in the sounds of birds or other wildlife in the area, the burbling of water flowing, the sound of your feet crunching dry leaves or pebbles, the smell of the soil or flowers, the texture of tree bark, the feeling of wind blowing across your skin, the visual beauty in the fractals in tree branches, the colors, and anything else you notice.

<p>Yoga is a fantastic way to improve physical strength and flexibility while cultivating a more peaceful inner life. 
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>This practice was developed over 5000 years ago in India, and it’s a holistic philosophy that teaches a path toward physical, mental, and emotional peace and enlightenment. It also includes a framework for developing ethical ways of interacting with others and creating positive/healthy habits in one’s daily life.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Yoga is for everyone, and it’s about more than just how far you can do the splits, how long you can hold a headstand, or whether you can touch your head with your toes.

<h3>Mindfulness Meditation</h3>

</div>
<div class="article-description">
<p>Mindfulness Meditation is the practice of taking time to be aware and fully experience the present moment. So often, what causes us stress and unhappiness is our worry about the future or our obsession with the past. </p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Anxiety also often arises out of an unhelpful aversion to certain conditions or events in our lives. Practicing mindfulness and equanimity helps us slow down and find contentment and gratitude in the present moment. </p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>The concept of mindfulness meditation is quite simple but takes some practice to fully understand and experience the benefits.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>1) Find a place to sit comfortably</strong></p> 
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>You can sit on the floor with your legs crossed (the traditional meditation posture) or in a chair that allows your feet to rest flat on the floor for a balanced and relaxed posture.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>2) Begin to follow your breath with your attention</strong></p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>You might even think “in” as you naturally breathe in and “out” as you naturally breathe out. No need to control or change the breath; just notice it.</p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>3) Be kind to yourself and keep practicing</strong></p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>When your mind gets carried away with thoughts, and it will…a lot, gently (without judgement or frustration) bring your attention back to your breath. 
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>An alternative approach:</strong></p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p>Another method for dealing with random thoughts is to imagine each thought as a cloud floating by in the “sky of your consciousness.” Let the thought come, and let it go without clinging to it or letting it distract you from focusing on your breathing. 
</p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<p><strong>The Benefits of Meditation</strong></p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="img">

<p><strong>An important side note:</strong></p>

<p>Protect others’ dignity and privacy. Give without the expectation of praise from others or repayment in social status. </p>
