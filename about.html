   <p>I'm KaDee (they/she), the creator of this website. I started building <i>Curated Wisdom</i> when I started learning how to build websites from scratch. The content is stuff I enjoy learning and thinking about. When I'm not working on new stuff to post here, I'm a university professor of music, composer, oboist, amateur recording engineer, certified yoga instructor,  home coffee roaster, and vegetable gardener. You can find more of my music and yoga content on Instagram. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/enbyyogi/">@enbyyogi</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/quantumcalm/">@quantumcalm</a>.</p>
   <div class=divider></div>
   <p>HERE IS WHAT YOU'LL FIND ON CURATED WISDOM:</p> 

   <p>--Tips for better mental health</p>
   <p>--Tips for better physical health</p>
   <p>--Tips for a more intentional, meaningful, and satisfying life</p>
   <p>--My favorite vegan recipes</p>
   <p>--Yoga classes you can do at home</p>
   <p>--Blog posts that provide hacks for the kitchen, your mood, embracing diversity, and more!</p>
   <p>--Tough questions pondered, and maybe answered</p>
   <p>--"How-to" content for managing day-to-day life</p>
   
   <p>None of these ideas are totally mine. It's stuff I've learned along the way
   that's made my life more enjoyable, healthier, and more manageable.
   That's why I've called this place <i>Curated Wisdom</i>.</p>
