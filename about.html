   <p>I'm KaDee (they/she), the creator of this website. I started building <i>Curated Wisdom</i> when I started learning how to build websites from scratch. The content is stuff I enjoy learning and thinking about. When I'm not working on new stuff to post here, I'm a university professor of music, composer, oboist, recording engineer, yoga instructor,  home coffee roaster, and gardener. You can find more of my music and yoga content on Instagram. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/enbyyogi/">@enbyyogi</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/quantumcalm/">@quantumcalm</a>.</p>
